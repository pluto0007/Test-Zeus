/*a double-ended queue (dequeue, often abbreviated to deque, pronounced deck) is an 
 * abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or 
 * removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).Deque interfaces can be implemented 
 * using various types of collections such as LinkedList or ArrayDeque classes. 
 * For example, deque can be declared as:
 * 
 * Deque deque = new LinkedList<>();
 * or
 * Deque deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
 * 
 * Input :
 * The first line of input contains two integers N and M: representing the total number 
 * of integers and the size of the subarray, respectively. The next line contains N space separated integers.
 * 
 * Output:
 * *Print the maximum number of unique integers among all possible contiguous subarrays of size M, i.e 3.
